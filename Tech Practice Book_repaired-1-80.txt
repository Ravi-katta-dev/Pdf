A ferrite beads is a type of choke that suppresses high-
frequency electronic noise in electronic circuits. While 
toroidal  cores are small MnZn based soft ferrite cores. 
Both (ferrite beads and toroidal cores) are related to  
inductors.  • The potential coil is connected across Z2. 
• It reads the voltage across Z2 only.
